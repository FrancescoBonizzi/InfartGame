- A complete level with increasing difficulty
- A lot of farts
- Original soundtrack
- Handmade graphic

The game is entirely **free** and open source: I didn't use any third party library to track or log user events. There are no ads too.

I coded this game with these libraries:
- [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame)
- [FbonizziMonoGame](https://github.com/FrancescoBonizzi/FbonizziMonoGame)
